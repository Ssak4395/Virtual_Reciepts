Our project's main objective is to develop an efficient and reliable mobile application that stores, 
manages and retrieves user receipts. In the digital age where paper receipts are becoming more 
redundant, our product allows users to scan their physical receipt into our app. Using Optical 
Character Recognition(OCR), particular details from the receipt will be extracted and stored into 
the system. Overall, our software allows users to maintain and organise their receipts into one 
centralised hub for efficient retrieval.
